# Console-Based_Collection
My collection of my console-based programs, made for Windows.

This repository has all of my console-based programs since the start of my C++ programming journey.

My main piece of being-developed work is called TerminalAppGen2. Basically a terminal emulator with many cool and fun features that you can use! I also included the previous iteration of this program (TerminalApp 1.0) with source code to give you an idea of how I've improved.

I also included a few apps that are made for one purpose (something I call a solo-app). All of these are included in TerminalApp Gen 2 anyway, so you can take the solo-apps if you don't want the full TerminalApp utility.

The best part is that it all comes with source code, and you're free to use it for whatever you want (just please don't sell the code or something like that).
You can always give me feedback as well, just so I know how to improve.

Thanks for visiting! :)
