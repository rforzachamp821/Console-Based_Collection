___TerminalApp Gen 2 Update 4 Bugfixes and New Features___

Also welcome an easter egg! Hint: An event began 1 day after the release of this update (1st May 2022).

New Features:
- 6 new commands, which are: calculator, converter, mario, ansireset, webopen and randnum.
- Now keeps all terminal files in a folder to keep space uncluttered.
- Ansi command improved.
- Echo and Colour commands can now have their options typed without pressing Enter (If you only type the name of the
  command, it'll still work as normal).
- Reduced amount of text in some areas so you don't have to read so much, also makes the terminal easier to use.
- yes/no confirmation whenever you're starting the tutorial from the terminal has been placed, as people accidentally 
  type the command number in (which is 1).
- For distinguision between coltxt and colourtxt, the name of the coltxt command  was changed to just 'colour'.
- Ansi now allows colour codes to replace all other colours until you reset the ansi colours.
- Increased slow character outputting speed by 5ms because people wanted it to be faster.
- Changed the army car design in the Car Dodge- Hard game because the old one just looked ugly.


Bugfixes:
- Fixed buffer overflow issues in some areas of the terminal.
- Fixed a bug with ansi not saving your text colour codes.
- Fixed a bug where the easy car game would not save your score.
- Fixed bugs in the car and guess games where colours would not work properly sometimes.
- Fixed a few terminal colour issues.
- Fixed a bug where the notesay command would not read out notes set with the note command, and instead post an error.
- Fixed bugs with the textinfo command where it would not post the correct number of letters and words in a string.
- Fixed an issue where any key pressed when characters are being outputted slowly would affect the next input opportunity.
- Fixed many problems in the tutorial, such as colours being reset to default after the tutorial.
- Revamped some old code in the program so bugs that I may have not found might have gotten fixed.


Known Issues:
NOTE: Keep in mind that these are issues that may never be fixed.

- The colour command can just easily be activated by typing 'colour' in the start of any command. This most likely won't
  get fixed due to its unimportance.
- Same thing for the echo command as above.
