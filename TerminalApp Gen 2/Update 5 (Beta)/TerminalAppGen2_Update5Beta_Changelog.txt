TerminalApp Gen 2 - Update 5: Beta - Changelog
_________________________________________________________________________________________
This time around, I tried adding a small beta testing release to see if I missed any bugs.

__Features and Changes__
- New commands have been added, which are: commandnum, cry, stopwatch, filemode, pause, nodisp, disp
- A new GAME has been added, and it's called Snap Game! It's inspired by a game called Snap which I used to play when I was a little kid.
- The About command has been unlocked and can now be used/explored.
- Added a new feature called FileParse, where you can argument a file with the program and let TerminalApp run off it (like scripting). It's currently in beta, please give feedback about it if possible.
- Removed the initial randnum command and placed it under the calculator command because it makes sense there.
- Added some colour to serveral commands, such as the Einstein command.
- Changed the wording in some commands to make them easier to understand.
- Added skill levels to both car games, that judge your score skill level - They come in: Below Average, Average, Insane, G.O.A.T Level and GOD level.
- Cleaned up some source code and unnecessary functions that I forgot to remove a long time ago.

__Bugfixes__
- Fixed the prev command not showing any capital letters.
- Fixed a problem with the colour command sometimes not registering when executed the first time.
- Fixed an issue where the colour was sometimes changing randomly after input.
